# Summary

* Which framework I went with? VueJS... I have professional experience in React and Angular and not in VueJS. I had done small POC's couple of years ago on Vue but I don't remember much of it now.
* So despite this, why I went with VueJS over my comfort zone of Angular and ReactJS? Well, the answer lies here only.. Comfort zone.. I wanted to challenge myself to go throught the Vue doc's and try to create this assignment. That's one of the reason I am looking for job switch, to challenge myself, grow myself, upscale my skills.
* Hence the reason I went with VueJS 3 with vue-router, bootstrap 5, apex charts.
* There are lot' of things to improve in codebase, but I tried my best to do much as possible within the time constraint and manage my personal/professional life. But yes there are things that could be improved, but despite that I think I did well :)
